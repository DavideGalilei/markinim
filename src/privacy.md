*Privacy Policy*
From using this bot, you agree to the following privacy policy. It can be viewed at any time by using the `/privacy` command in private chat with the bot.

*Data Collection*
Markinim collects and stores the following data:
- Telegram user ID
- Chat ID
- Message ID
- Message text
- Message date
- Chat settings (e.g. if the emojipasta mode is enabled or if the bot is enabled in the chat)

This data is stored in a SQLite database and is used for the following purposes:
- Generating messages using a Markov chain algorithm

*Data Sharing*
*Markinim does not share this data with any third parties*. The data is stored on the server where the bot is running, and is not shared with anyone else.
The data is stored indefinitely, but you can request its deletion at any time by using the `/deleteme` command in private chat with the bot, or by contacting the bot owner directly.

*Data Isolation*
The messages used for the markov generation are isolated on a per-chat basis, meaning that messages from one chat are not mixed with messages from another chat. This is done to ensure that the generated messages are relevant to the chat where they are being used, and to maintain the privacy of the users.
Markinim also has a feature that allows users to delete all the messages they have sent in a specific chat from the bot's database, by using the `/delete` command in the chat.

*Data Access*
Markinim is an opt-in service, meaning that you have to start a chat with the bot in order for it to collect and store data about you. You can stop the bot from collecting data about you at any time by using the `/manageconsent` command in private chat with the bot.

You can also request a copy of the data stored about you by contacting the bot owner directly. Note that aggregating this data may take some time, so please be patient.

*Contact*
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact the bot owner directly.
